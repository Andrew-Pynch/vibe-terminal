[36ce9d73-3d46-49f7-bde8-3039e57f9d8e] STDOUT: Okay, I am the Root Orchestrator Vibe agent. My goal is to plan the development of the `vibe-terminal` project. I need to analyze the project state and interact with the user to define immediate goals. Based on the `INSTRUCTION.md` and the `GEMINI.md` context, the project is currently in Phase 6.1, focusing on stabilizing "Rambo Mode" and Multi-Provider Support. I need to verify the rate limit fix for the Gemini API and investigate multi-provider support.

[36ce9d73-3d46-49f7-bde8-3039e57f9d8e] STDOUT: Here's my plan:

[36ce9d73-3d46-49f7-bde8-3039e57f9d8e] STDOUT: 1.  Verify the rate limit fix by starting the server and triggering a session.
[36ce9d73-3d46-49f7-bde8-3039e57f9d8e] STDOUT: 2.  Investigate multi-provider support by exploring CLI tools like `claude` and designing a generic `ProviderAdapter` trait for the Rust server.

[36ce9d73-3d46-49f7-bde8-3039e57f9d8e] STDOUT: I will now use `vibe-ask` to confirm these goals with the user.
