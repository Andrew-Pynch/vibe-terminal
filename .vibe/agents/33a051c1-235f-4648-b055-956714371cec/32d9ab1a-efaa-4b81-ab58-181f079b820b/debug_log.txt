[32d9ab1a-efaa-4b81-ab58-181f079b820b] STDOUT: Okay, I need to update the Rust Server API to handle the `vibe-report` and `vibe-complete` shim signals. This likely involves defining new API endpoints, handling the data sent by the shims, and updating the server's internal state.

[32d9ab1a-efaa-4b81-ab58-181f079b820b] STDOUT: Here's my plan:
[32d9ab1a-efaa-4b81-ab58-181f079b820b] STDOUT: 
[32d9ab1a-efaa-4b81-ab58-181f079b820b] STDOUT: 1.  **Explore the existing API:** I'll start by examining the Rust server code to understand the current API structure and how it handles requests. I'll look for relevant files like `src/main.rs` or any API definition files.
[32d9ab1a-efaa-4b81-ab58-181f079b820b] STDOUT: 2.  **Define new API endpoints:** Based on the `vibe-report` and `vibe-complete` commands, I'll define the necessary API endpoints in the Rust code. These endpoints will likely accept POST requests with data about the agent ID, session ID, progress, and result.
[32d9ab1a-efaa-4b81-ab58-181f079b820b] STDOUT: 3.  **Implement request handling logic:** I'll implement the logic to handle the incoming requests. This will involve extracting the data from the request body, updating the server's internal state (e.g., agent progress, session status), and potentially logging the events.
[32d9ab1a-efaa-4b81-ab58-181f079b820b] STDOUT: 4.  **Update server state:** I'll need to ensure that the server's in-memory state is updated correctly when it receives signals from the shims. This might involve creating new data structures to store agent progress and session results.
[32d9ab1a-efaa-4b81-ab58-181f079b820b] STDOUT: 5.  **Testing:** After implementing the changes, I'll need to test the new API endpoints to ensure they work as expected. This might involve using `curl` or a similar tool to send requests to the server and verifying that the server's state is updated correctly.

[32d9ab1a-efaa-4b81-ab58-181f079b820b] STDOUT: I'll start by exploring the existing API to get a better understanding of the codebase.
