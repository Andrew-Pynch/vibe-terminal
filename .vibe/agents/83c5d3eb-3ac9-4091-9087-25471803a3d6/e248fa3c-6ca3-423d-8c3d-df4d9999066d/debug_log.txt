[e248fa3c-6ca3-423d-8c3d-df4d9999066d] STDERR: The assistant is in a definitive unproductive state. Over the last 12 turns, it has repeated the exact same action: calling the `run_shell_command` tool with the command `echo "Still waiting for user to resolve the working directory and server-side issues with 'vibe-report'."`. The assistant's thought process is also stuck, consistently stating that it is waiting for the user and cannot proceed. This is a classic repetitive action loop with no forward progress being made.
