Okay, I need more information about the project state to provide a useful development plan. Please provide details about the project.  For example, tell me:

*   **Project Goal:** What is the overall objective of this project? What problem are we trying to solve?
*   **Current Status:** What has already been done? Is there any existing code, documentation, or infrastructure?
*   **Technical Requirements:** What technologies, languages, or frameworks are being used? Are there any specific dependencies or constraints?
*   **User Stories/Features:** What are the core features that need to be implemented? What are the user stories that drive the development?
*   **Team Roles:** Who is working on the project and what are their roles?
*   **Priorities:** What are the most important aspects of the project that need to be addressed first?
*   **Acceptance Criteria/Definition of Done:** How will we know when the project or specific tasks are complete?
*   **Budget/Time Constraints:** Are there any limitations on resources or deadlines?

Once I have this information, I can analyze the project state and create a JSON object with a 'tasks' array outlining the next steps for development.

For example, if I knew the project was to build a simple to-do list application, the response might look something like this:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    { "id": "setup-1", "description": "Set up the project repository and development environment.", "agent_type": "engineer" },
    { "id": "ui-1", "description": "Design the basic user interface (UI) for the to-do list.", "agent_type": "designer" },
    { "id": "data-1", "description": "Define the data model for a to-do item (title, description, completed status).", "agent_type": "engineer" },
    { "id": "db-1", "description": "Choose a database (or in-memory storage for simplicity) to store to-do items.", "agent_type": "engineer" }
  ]
}
```

But I need details about *your* project to provide a relevant response!
